Parse::Syntax 0.02   by Sherzod Ruzmetov, a.k.a. sherzodR
---------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This is the alpha version! Changes to be made in the 
next releases are not guaranteed to be backward compatible.
Please read the documentation of the respective version if 
you intend to apply it.

The application is installed in standard way by running 
Makefile.PL.

Following is a refreshed for module installation in *nix

% perl Makefile.PL

% make

% make install

After installing the module you have to copy the Stx/*.stx files
to some location of your choise (you don't have to though). It has all 
the syntax files that our Parse::Syntax file expects to use to be able
to parse the program the way intended. Also, the location of the Stx/ 
folder should be parsed as a parameter to the contructor method 
( new() ), so it is worth to remember the location of the Stx/ folder.
